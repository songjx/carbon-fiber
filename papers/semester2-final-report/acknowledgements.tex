First and foremost we wish to thank our advisor Dr. Stan Wei for his guidance on this project and for providing us access to the FANUC robot arm. We also wish to thank Dr. David Wootton and Dr. Eric Lima for providing specifc advise related to material analysis while we were developing the filament as well as general intermittent guidance. Machinists Brian Yudin and Sinisa Janjusevic deserve thanks for their guidance pertaining to the mechanical design of the extruder and in the proper use of machine shop tools. Dr. Scott Bondi also deserves to be thanked for his assistance in locating a viable finite element software package for analyzing composites, as well as providing initial guidance on how to use the software. Related to the finite element analysis aspect of this project, we would like to acknowledge Keith Ng for obtaining and installing \emph{ANSYS Composite PrepPost} on all computer center computers. Dionne Lutz deserves to be thanked for her assitance in providing chemicals and tools for filament development, as we as microscoping imaging equipment. Finally, we wish to thank Jay Strybis, a robotics consultant, for sharing his knowledge of FANUC robots specifically pertaining to analog outputs used for speed control.\\
