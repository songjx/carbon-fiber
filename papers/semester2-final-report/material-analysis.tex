\section{Material Analysis}

\indent

Material analysis will be performed on the printed CFRP parts. Part geometry will be chosen such that CFRP curved layer, ABS curved layer, and ABS cartesian layer parts can be printed for comparison. Specific to part geometries, the Instron Tension Tester will be used to implement bending, compression and tensile tests as appropriate to quantify the strength and stiffness of each print. Strain gauges may even be placed along exposed fibers in attempt to determine fiber-specific stresses and strains.\\
