\section{3D Printing Toolchain}

\subsection{Extruder}

\indent

The extruder is the mechanism responsible for depositing the filament in a 3D printing system. Generally, this mechanism includes a motor that drives a gripping mechanism, which reels in and pushes the filament into a heated nozzle. The nozzle heats the filament to a soft state and lays the filament on the printing bed or on an already printed layer to create the part.\\

In the case of the curved layer carbon fiber 3D printer, the extruder is required to mount to the robot arm, be compact\footnote{The compact size is required for two reasons. First, to ensure that induced torque on the robot arm joints and gripper remain within safe operating conditions. Second, to readily permit the nozzle to deposit material when not perpendicular to the build platform, which will be required for printing curved layers.}, and accept filaments of a variety of sizes (likely ranging in diameter from 1.75 mm to 3 mm). \\

Figure~\ref{fig:old extruder} presents the initial design of the extruder in \emph{SolidWorks}. The extruder mounts to the Fanuc grippers and is constructed out of a combination of machined aluminum parts and RepRap hardware (nozzle, J-head, J-head mounting plate, ceramic heating element, thermistor, fan, and fan mount). This configuration locates the nozzle outlet along the mid-plane of the grippers for simple coordinate transformations when programming the robot to print. Laser-cut acrylic gears provide a 3:1 step up in torque from the stepper motor and drive a notched screw, which grips and pushes the filament into the nozzle. A bearing opposite the screw provides counter-pressure and its mounting plates can adjust the distance between the screw and bearing to accommodate different filament sizes.\\

To assess the feasibility of the initial extruder design, minor tweaks were implemented within the CAD to make a laser-cut prototype.  Figure~\ref{fig:prototype extruder} shows the prototype mounted on the FANUC grippers. The prototype served its purpose and demonstrated numerous problems with the initial design. There were some mis-measurements of RepRap hardware, using spacers instead of threaded standoffs decreased the rigidity of the structure, the structure was a bit larger than desired, and a few undetected interferences were discovered. Subsequently, the extruder then went through a series of redesigns to develop an acceptable configuration.\\

Figure~\ref{fig:extruder iso} presents a rendering of the final extruder design. Figure~\ref{fig:extruder drawing} provides general dimensions and annotations to fully present the extruder design concept. The final design is significantly smaller than the initial design, will require less machining, and uses less fastening hardware. The size decrease was accomplished by using smaller gears (50\% scaled versions of gears dimensions taken from \emph{SDP-SI}\footnote{\url{http://www.sdp-si.com/}} and located the stepper motor directly beneath the FANUC grippers. As part of the design process the gears were laser-cut, and physically tested to ensure that the teeth would not shear off under a load less than the stall torque of the stepper motor, before being fully committed to this design. The stepper motor (Sparkfun ROB-10846) outputs 68 oz-in of torque and has a resolution of 400 steps/revolution. Two laser-cut acrylic gears step up the torque to 204 oz-in.\footnote{Most extruders in the 3D printing community use analogous stepper motors and utilize gear trains to step up the torque. Common gear ratios range from 2:1 to 4:1 depending on the specific qualities of the filament. Given that the specifics of the filament are not yet fully determined, the mean value was used.} A partially threaded screw will be notched on the mill to contain teeth-like features along a portion of its length. These teeth will grip the filament and push it into the extruder. The screw rides along two bronze PTFE-coated bearings to ensure smooth rotation during printing. Two adjustment plates locate a bearing just opposite the screw to provide counter-pressure during printing. The plates are secured in place using four screws, which can be loosened or tightened to adjust the distance between the screw and bearing to accommodate different filament sizes. Shims or spring washers may have to be utilized to located this adjustable mechanism in its optimal position for the official CFRP.\\

The extruder will be machined with aluminum to provide rigidity. Many 3D printers utilize 3D printed bodies for mounting RepRap hardware, but the associated poor tolerances and material flexibility are not ideal for the curved layer carbon fiber 3D printer. Machining the extruder out of aluminum will allow easy implementation of any future adjustments and ensures all mechanisms will align properly. The entire extruder assembly secures to the FANUC gripper with four screws.\\

\subsection{Control Electronics}

\indent 

The extruder is controlled by a Megatronics control board, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:megatronics}, which was developed for the RepRap open source 3D printer project. The board contains all the necessary electronics to drive a Cartesian coordinate based FDM desktop 3D printer. The board can drive numerous positioning and extruder motors, heating elements, sensors, displays, and more. Because the FANUC robot handles the extruder positioning, the Megatronics board will be used to control the extruder elements only.\\

\subsubsection{Firmware}

\indent

When used in RepRap printers, the Megatronics board is typically used with one of several open source firmwares that are also associated with the RepRap project. Because these firmwares were designed with Cartesian desktop FDM printers in mind, they work well with the Megatronics board. The chosen firmware is uploaded to the board using a USB cable. For the FANUC-mounted extruder, a suitable firmware will be chosen and modified to work with the FANUC robot.\\

The firmware will be modified to control only the components present on the FANUC-mounted extruder. The firmware's timing functions must be modified as well. Normally, the firmware calculates its own filament feed rates and motor speeds in order to ensure that the flow rate of the extruded material follows the surface speed of the extruder with respect to the print surface. Because the FANUC controller has its own closed-loop control and is much less flexible than the RepRap firmware, the firmware will be modified to monitor the FANUC robot speed and position, and act accordingly. The monitoring will be accomplished by polling robot status system variables from a digital output on the FANUC controller.

\subsubsection{Enclosure}

\indent

The Megatronics board is too large to be mounted directly to the extruder, so it has been mounted inside the FANUC robot cage. The board is housed in a clear acrylic housing, shown in Figures~\ref{fig:megatronics-mount-back} and \ref{fig:megatronics-mount-front}, which serves several purposes. The housing protects the board from debris and accidental touches by either people or by the robot. The clear front makes the on-board status LEDs visible for debugging and operation. The back of the housing has built-in slots that provide anchors for cable management hardware. The cable management hardware will both organize the wires connected to the board and provide strain relief. The strain relief is especially important for the wires that connect the board and the extruder, because they will move with the extruder. The housing is positioned in a location that will cause the least interference between the wires and the arm. The power and USB cables for the board will be routed through the robot cage members. The USB cable will provide convenient access for updating the board firmware and collecting data using a laptop.
