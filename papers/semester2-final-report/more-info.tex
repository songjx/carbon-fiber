\subsection{FANUC}
To obtain PDFs of the referenced manuals for the FANUC equipment described in this report, contact JackieSong, Peter Ascoli, or Professor Wei. For spare parts, tech support, and repairs, make an account at the FANUC America cRc Online Site at \url{https://crc.frc.com/main.aspx}. The FANUC-provided F number is required to sign up; the new account will have access to all previous support tickets. The F number is printed on several labels on the controller and robot, pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:f-no}. Some other FANUC equipment identification labels are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stickers}.
