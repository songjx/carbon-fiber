Fanuc Programming
    TOOL frame setup
        resulting frame settings
    USER frame setup
        resulting frame settings
    program commands
        offset loops
        data registers
        position registers
    position coordinate diagram from solidworks model
    explanation of tool orientation choice and tool offset for offsetting contour to create thickened layers properly - also choice of contour shape wrt available move commands (circular interpolation)
    discussion of more flexible robot programming for the future - don't rely on teaching-based system for more complex toolpaths of course
    speed output (thanks to jay strybis)
        IO config, system variables, etc
