The setup of a curved layer carbon fiber 3D printer was completed. The fabricated extruder was tested using ABS filament and shown to be fully operable. The FANUC robot system was programmed to print a curved layer carbon fiber specimen. A potential CFRP filament was prototyped and shown to have promising mechanical qualities. Finite element analysis, using filament properties, demonstrated a sample specimen to be stronger than a standard ABS 3D printed part with stiffness comparable to aluminum. Prior to achieving a full test print, a more realiable and efficient manufacturing method for the CFRP filament must be developed. Hopefully, this project will be continued next year, where students can refine the filament, physically print and test larger parts, and ultimately begin the next generation of 3D printing.
