send links to wei about open source printing projects, kit/part vendors
send links to wei from research into current work on composite part printing
read up on STL vs AMF file formats
get lab access
talk to Chris about LaTeX (lol)
check out Universal Robot (open interface, in python)
buy a kit?

--

talk to wei about:
	robot arm kinematics - resolution varies in space within work envelope?
	robot arm software/control interface
	when to test traditional 3D prints - which printer to use (makerbot or our arm?)
start using version control
organize bookmarks document into categories
use cooper library subscriptions to look for more papers

got complete R-30iA Series Controller Training Manual from wei; can't seem to
find this one online
note: karel the robot and karel++ are educational languages, and are
completely separate from the proprietary KAREL language used by FANUC
registered for FANUC customer resource center (cRc), hopefully they approve
and follow through with "free software downloads" promised in front of
training manual, namely the OlpcPRO software, for translating KAREL code
need to see if our robot has ASCII upload feature
downloaded karel reference manual from scribd

research what chopped fiber/other composite filaments are currently in use
and/or available for purchase; check out what they used for that printed carbon fiber car chassis
according to wei, the FANUC robot won't be ready to use until the cage is
finished and the base is rotated 90 deg (no ETA for some reason)...also, vision camera + load cell
might get in the way of mounting our own tooling
PUMA 700 robot could work in the meantime as a starting point. has 0.008 in
(0.2 mm) repeatability, so should work; will meet wei to go over PUMA
operation when key cards work again
stay away from UV cured resins; if mark forged can print using only heat, so
can we
uploaded abstract to moodle

generate some possible use cases, for context 
make a map of where 3D printing is now, who's working on what - use to get a
broader vision, then narrow down 
what's important? 
what else can we do with 1 or more robot arms?
