got complete R-30iA Series Controller Training Manual from wei; can't seem to
find this one online
note: karel the robot and karel++ are educational languages, and are
completely separate from the proprietary KAREL language used by FANUC
registered for FANUC customer resource center (cRc), hopefully they approve
and follow through with "free software downloads" promised in front of
training manual, namely the OlpcPRO software, for translating KAREL code
need to see if our robot has ASCII upload feature
downloaded karel reference manual from scribd
